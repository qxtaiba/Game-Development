# final-project-cs

This project comprises a 2D, overhead shooter  game inspired by "The Binding of Isaac". 

The game will display one infinite room, with waves of enemy targets moving, shooting, or both. 

The player will lose health if touched by an enemy or their  projectiles, and  will retalliate by firing back.

The game itself is infinitely expandable based on the creativity of the desginer to include more items, mechanics, and foes on top of the core, base game.

This is simply a prototype demonstrator and aims to show the potential of the program. This is a very basic form of what the game could be.
